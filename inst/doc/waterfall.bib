@article{box:2003,
	Abstract = {Computers are increasingly employed to monitor the
                  performance of complex systems. An important issue is
                  how to evaluate the performance of such monitors. In
                  this article we introduce a three-dimensional
                  representation that we call a ``waterfall chart'' of the
                  probability of an alarm as a function of time and the
                  condition of the system. It combines and shows the
                  conceptual relationship between the cumulative
                  distribution function of the run length and the power
                  function. The value of this tool is illustrated with
                  an application to Page's one-sided Cusum
                  algorithm. However, it can be applied in general for
                  any monitoring system.},

	Abstract = {In this article we discuss our experience designing
                  and implementing a statistical computing language. In
                  developing this new language, we sought to combine
                  what we felt were useful features from two existing
                  computer languages. We feel that the new language
                  provides advantages in the areas of portability,
                  computational efficiency, memory management, and
                  scoping.},
